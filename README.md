This portfolio reflects the efforts put into my CS 4375 Introduction to Machine Learning class. I quite frankly had a hard time in this class overall, but that being said - I'm proud of what I accomplished and had the oppertunity to learn. This was the introduction to what I need to achieve my long term goals. My plan is to combine my passion for fitness as a personal trainer and machine learning together to develop an educational fitness app and create a virtual coach for form correction interface usinng machine learning. I don't necessarily have a plan for how to go into this feild as it changes, the best I can do is always put my best foot forward and never be comfortable with how much I know. As the industry evolves, its up to me to evolve with it. I want to work with a larger fitness brand such as Equinox, Alive Fitness, or a body building coaching company to help them break into the new age of media and data analyis. Fitness has been one way for a very long time and hasn't been accessible to everyone and I hope that what I learned here can help me take a step towards fixing that.
